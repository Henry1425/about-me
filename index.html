        <h1> Introduction</h1>
        <p>I'm an entrepreneur at heart.I love coming up with new ideas on products that make life easier and fun, whether it's a new product or an exisiting product.</p>
        <p>That's what got me interested in programming. The fact that you can come up with an idea in your head and make it a reality, is amazing.</p>
        <p>My faith in god and my family are super important to me, it's what keeps me grounded. That being said, my focus right now is finishing my education at Thinkful because I want to provide for my family and give them all the things they need. I'm excited to be a student at Thinkful.</p>

        <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
        <p>I'm from the concrete jungle, the city that never sleeps, New York City. If you can make there you can make it anywhere, but enough of the slogans. I was born and raised in New York and loved it there. The mix of cultures and diversity of people and the fact that there is so much to do, is what I love so much.</p>
